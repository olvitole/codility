I own a parking garage that provides valet parking service. When a customer pulls up to the entrance they are either rejected because the garage is full, or they are given a ticket they can use to collect their car, and the car is parked for them.

Given a set of different parking bays (Small, Medium, Large), write a control program to accept/reject cars (also small, medium or large) as they arrive, and issue/redeem tickets.





class Garage{

HashMap<int,ParkingBay> parkingBays;

isFull()
issueTicketAndPark()

// assign Bay
assignBay(Car.size);

// get the bay after assigning
getBay(int);

}


class Car{
  size;
  CarSize getSize();
}

public enum CarSize {
    SMALL,
    MEDIUM,LARGE 
}

class SamllBay extends ParkingBay{
    
}

class MediumBay extends ParkingBay{
    
}

class LargeBay extends ParkingBay{
    
}

class ParkingBay{
  int id;
  boolean open;
-doesItFit(Car.size);
 boolean isOpen();
}

Control -> garage
parkCar(Car) // null if no space, or Ticket
